# Steps

Release early, release often. Don't be lazy.

To use this doc: just replace X.Y.Z with the major.minor.patch version of
the release. The sequence of commands below should be good to copy and
paste, but please pay attention to details!


- tag `main` 

    git tag X.Y.Z
    git push --tags


- create release notes after all main changes from last tag

    git log --first-parent main --decorate > release-X.Y.Z.txt


- change the version number in `pyempaq/_version.py`


- build the tarball 

    rm -rf dist/
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel


- release in Github

    xdg-open https://github.com/facundobatista/pyempaq/tags

    You should see all project tags, the top one should be this release.
    In the menu at right of the tag tag you just created, choose 'create
    release'. Copy the release notes into the release description.

    Attach the `dist/` files

    Click on "Publish release"


- release to PyPI

    fades -d twine -x twine upload --verbose dist/*


- commit, push
