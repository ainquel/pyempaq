PyEmpaq 0.3 released

I'm happy to announce the release of PyEmpaq 0.3. 

PyEmpaq is a simple but powerful Python packer to run any project with any virtualenv dependencies anywhwere.

With PyEmpaq you can convert any Python project into a single `.pyz` file with all the project's content packed inside. 

That single file is everything that needs to be distributed. When the final user executes it, the original project will be expanded, its dependencies installed in a virtualenv, and then executed. Note that no special permissions or privileges are required, as everything happens in the user environment.

Both the packaging and the execution are fully multiplatorm. This means that you can pack a project in Linux, Windows, Mac or whatever, and it will run ok in Linux, Windows, Mac or whatever. The only requirement is Python to be already installed.


What's new in this version?

- Added 'include' and 'exclude' configuration options to have full control on what is inside the packed file.

- Reuse the existing project directory only if it has a complete previous installation.

- Support the declaration of a minimum Python version to run the packed project.

- Expose the .pyz path to the project being run.

- Now used logging to expose messages to developer and users, with different verbosity levels.

- Set up the proper PATH in the end command environment.

- Added a -V/--version option to just print the version and exit.

- Run tests (unit and integration) in Linux, MacOS and Windows.
